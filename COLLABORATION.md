# COLLABORATION

- Patricia Guajardo

	For this lab, I collaborated with Sebastian Nunez again, where he assisted with understanding concepts and the best algorithm so as to complete the assignment, with the suggestions, for example, the use of creating a class for each thread, as well as the use of While loops for my queues to have each of the actions continue, until finished.
